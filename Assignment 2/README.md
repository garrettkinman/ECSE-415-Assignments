# Assignment 2

## Packages Used

* Numpy (1.17.3)
* cv2 (4.4.0)
* matplotlib (3.1.1)

## How It Was Run

* I ran it locally in Jupyter Lab
* Every time I imported an image, I used a line of the form `numbers_img = cv2.imread("book.jpg")`
* If you wish to run in google colab, mount to google drive and replace the path with the appropriate path
